## Frontend Code Challenge

For this challenge, you will be building a basic CRUD app. You will have 1 hour to work on the goals outlined below.

### Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Start up the backend
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
3. Write frontend code in the `app` directory.

### Goals

1. Layout & Content - Reproduce the notification list screen [design](https://github.com/AndrewBantug/forge_frontend_interview/blob/master/design.png).
The data for notifications should come from a request to the server. Exact colors and dimensions are not expected, but
a reasonable approximation is. 
2. Filter functionality - A user should be able to view a list of notifications filtered by severity
3. Add & Remove Notification - A user should be able to add or remove a notification. This should be achieved with a 
request to the server.
